function printNumber(num) {
  console.log(num);
}

console.log(1);

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);

setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);
console.log(4);


output will be: 1, 4, 2, 3

This is because first of all 1 will be printed followed by 4 as these are synchronous tasks.
after this, the async calls are executed and the timeout functions are passed to browser which in turn makes call to the `printNumber` function and hence the numbers are printed respectively. The timeout value of 2 is less than 3, hence, 2 is printed before 3.
