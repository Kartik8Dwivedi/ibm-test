var arr1 = "john".split(''); 

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();

var arr3 = "jones".split('');

arr2.push(arr3);

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));

At line 1, arr1 contains an array containing: [j,o,h,n]
At line 2, arr2 contains an array containing: [n,h,o,j], this also mutates the original array arr1 and now arr1 and arr2 are referenced to each other
At line 3, arr3 contains an array containing: [j,o,n,e,s]
At line 4, arr2,push(arr3) converts the arr2 to: [n,h,o,j,[j,o,n,e,s]]
At line 5, the array 1 length is 5 and the output will be `j,o,n,e,s` as the offset is of -1
At line 6, the array 2 length is 5 and the output will again be same as line 5
