(function() {

    console.log(1); 

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000); 

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0); 

    console.log(4);

})();

The above code uses a IIFE syntax. 
- first of all 1 will be printed
- then 4 will be printed as the other two are async piece of code which will follow the event loop
- then 3 will be printed, as the call for 2 and 3 will be executed by browser, which will firstly execute the `console.log(3)` setTimeout function as it will end prior to the the another setTimeout callback. This result from browser will be sent to the event queue, which will be printed when the execution stack becomes empty.
- lastly, the 2 will be printed after a timespan of 1 second.
