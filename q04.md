Promise chaining is a process of using promises one after the other by using a promise inside a .then() call of a previous promise, this concept is widely used along with async/await procedure. The promises were introduced to overcome the callback hell in javascript. When a situation arises that the result of one asynchronous task depends on another and so on, in these cases we can use promise based syntax to increase readibility of the code and also to maintain it well. A example of promise based syntax is as follows:

      let promise1 = new Promise(()=>{
             setTimeout(() => resolve(100), 5000)
      }
      promise1.then(function(val){
             console.log(val) // 100
             return(500);
      }).then(function(val){
             console.log(val) // 500
      })

// This code is an example of promise chaining
