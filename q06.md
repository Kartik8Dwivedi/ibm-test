Callback hell is a situation when we chain one callback with another callback, which in turn is again backed with another set of callbacks, when the number of callback increases to a large extent, then we refer this as a callback hell situation. An example of callback hell is as follows

    const main = (callback) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            callback([100,200]);
        }, 5000)
    }
    const add = (arr) => {
        let sum = 0;
        for(let i of arr) {
            sum += i;
        }
        console.log(sum);
    }
    main(add);

In the above code one callback is backed by another callback, which results in a callback chaining which makes it difficult to debug the code and hence when lots of callbacks are introduced, it is referred to as a callback hell.
This callback hell can be solved by using the promise based syntax or the async-await syntax. Promise based syntax for the above code will be as follows:

        new Promise(()=>{
               setTimeout(() => {
               resolve([100,200])
        }, 5000)
        .then((val)=>{
               let sum = 0;
               val.forEach(e => {
                       sum += e;
                })
                console.log(sum)
        })
This promise based syntax makes our code more readable and maintainable.
The async-await method is as follows:

        async funtion(){
                 let arr = [];
                 await setTimeout(()=>{
                         arr = [100,200];
                  },5000)
                 let sum = 0;
                 arr.forEach(e => {
                       sum += e;
                  })
                  console.log(sum)
        }
This async-await method makes our code even more easier to understand and maintainable as well.
